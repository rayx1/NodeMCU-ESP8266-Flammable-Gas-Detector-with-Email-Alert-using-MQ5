# NodeMCU-ESP8266-Flammable-Gas-Detector-with-Email-Alert-using-MQ5
A WiFi-connected gas leakage alarm system using an ESP8266, MQ-5 gas sensor, buzzer, LED, and email notifications via SMTP.

## üöÄ Features

- Detects flammable gases (e.g., LPG, natural gas) using MQ-5
- Activates buzzer and LED on high gas concentration
- Sends email alert with ppm reading
- Cooldown period to prevent email spamming
- Continues to function offline (alarm still works)
- Automatically reconnects to WiFi if disconnected

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Required

- ESP8266 (e.g., NodeMCU)
- MQ-5 Gas Sensor (analog)
- Active buzzer
- LED with resistor (220Œ© recommended)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard or soldered circuit

## üîß Configuration

In `main.ino`, set your WiFi and email credentials:

```cpp
#define WIFI_SSID "YOUR_WIFI_SSID"
#define WIFI_PASSWORD "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD"

#define SMTP_HOST "smtp.yourprovider.com"
#define SMTP_PORT 465
#define AUTHOR_EMAIL "your_email@domain.com"
#define AUTHOR_PASSWORD "your_email_password"
#define RECIPIENT_EMAIL "recipient@domain.com"

## üì¶ Libraries Used 

ESP8266WiFi

ESP-Mail-Client

Install them via the Arduino Library Manager or clone the GitHub repos.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
Email only works when connected to WiFi.

Alarm (buzzer and LED) will work even without internet.

Make sure to calibrate the MQ-5 sensor in clean air during startup.

Sensitive data (passwords) should not be committed to public repositories.
